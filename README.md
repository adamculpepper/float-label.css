Float Labels for Bootstrap4 (with support for `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>` and Select2)

## Features
- Pure CSS only Float Labels
- Support for `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`
- Support for Select2 (with some JS needed to be added)
- error handling for missing pieces needed to get the float label working

## TODO
- ~~get `<textarea>` elements working~~
- create demo site
- get normal `<select>` elements working 100%
- error handling for select2 missing placeholder or label
- support for clearing the select2 value using jQuery (doesn't trigger change event this way)
